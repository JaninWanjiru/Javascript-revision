# More Javascript challenges revision
Here are some more Javascript challenges I solved for my personal revision and better understanding of Javascript basic data structures.

## Below are the challenges I tackled
- **Min of Negatives:** Write a function ```minOfNegatives``` that takes an array of numbers and returns the smallest negative number from an array. Return null if no negative number is found.
- **Object to array:** Write a function ```objectToArray``` that takes an object and returns an array of its values.
- **Capitalize words:** Write a function ```capitalizeWords``` that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with each word capitalized.
- **Group by Type:** Write a function ```groupByType``` that takes an array with mixed types and returns an object grouping elements by their type.
- **Remove Falsy values:** Write a function ```removeFalsy``` that takes an array and returns a new array without falsy values (false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN).
- **Sum Nested Arrays:** Write a function ```sumNested``` that takes an array of arrays of numbers and returns the total sum.

## How to run it
```bash
node index_2.js
```
